                <ul> <h> Ingredients:</h>
                    <li>Flour - 2 cups</li>
                    <li>Baking Powder - 1 1/2 tsp </li>
                    <li>Salt - 1/8 tsp</li>
                    <li>Butter - 1/2 cup</li>
                    <li>Sugar - 1 cup</li>
                    <li>Vanilla Extract - 1 tsp</li>
                    <li>Eggs - 2 </li>
                    <li>Milk - 3/4 cup</li>
                </ul>
                <ol> <h>Procedure:</h>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 180 degree celcius.</li>
                    <li>Combine the flour, baking powder in a medium bowl and sift it to remove any impurities.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. It takes about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add salt and vanilla to the butter mix and mix until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Separate the egg whites and yolks. Add the yolks to the milk and mix them together. Whip the egg whites
                        until they get light and fluffy.</li>
                    <li>Add the milk mixture to the butter mixture and combine them.</li>
                    <li>Mix the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients. After they become a nice homogenous mix gently fold in 
                        the whipped egg whites.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter in a greased pan and cook it for about 20 minutes. But as every oven is different,
                        start checking the cake after 15 minutes. To test the doneness, you can insert a toothpick into the centre 
                        of the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, it's done.</li>
